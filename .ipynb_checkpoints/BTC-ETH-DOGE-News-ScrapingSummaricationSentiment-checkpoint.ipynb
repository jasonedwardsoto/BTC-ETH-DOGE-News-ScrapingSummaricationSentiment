       "'Stay informed every day with Yahoo Finance\\'s free Fully Briefed newsletter. Renewed political tensions between the U.S. and China — which came to light this week as the Biden administration sat down with their Chinese counterparts for the first time to discuss a range of issues — could ensnarl vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA), which has pushed successfully into China in recent years. In fact, the heightened rhetoric between the two super economic superpowers may have already had blowback on Elon Musk\\'s electric car company. The Chinese government is restricting the use of Tesla vehicles by military staff and employees of vital state-owned companies, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Chinese officials reportedly have concerns that Tesla\\'s cars — outfitted with various data collecting capabilities — could serve as leakers of national security secrets. \"I have been saying for months now that Tesla\\'s level of integration of their business, of their research, of their sort of geo-tracking for which there is integration with Chinese maps, their development of A.I. with Chinese firms, and electric battery technology that\\'s not sustainable in China given the trajectory [on policy] that we are now on,\" policy expert and Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"Most American A.I. and technology companies are seen as critical for national security, they don\\'t have access in China — companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Tesla is the outlier.\" That outlier status has made China an incredibly important market for Tesla, and a key part of the investment thesis in the stock. Tesla\\'s sales in China clocked in at $6.66 billion in 2020, up 123% from a year earlier powered by strength in the Model 3. The business made up about 21% of Tesla\\'s overall 2020 sales. Tesla began deliveries of its China-made Model Y to Chinese consumers earlier this year. Bremmer warns Tesla now has a challenging road ahead in China in light of the recent development by the military. Musk\\'s response to the Chinese actions are important for investors to watch, suggests Bremmer. \"At a moment of some white knuckle tensions between the U.S. and China, Musk & Co. find themselves in a unique position (along with Apple) of being caught in the crossfire,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said. Tesla shares fell about 2% on the report, as investors pondered if China will take a harder line on Tesla\\'s sales to consumers. \"One'"

Cuban — when asked by DeGeneres about cryptocurrencies — decided to explain the importance of Dogecoin. He said his 11-year-old son, Jake, is involved in Dogecoin, buying about $30 worth. \\n    Related\\n   Cuban said the Dallas Mavericks accept Dogecoin — which started as an internet meme — in their team shop, too, according to CoinDesk. Cuban’s recent comments might be a good thing for Dogecoin owners, as his previous comments led to a spike in value, as I explained for the Deseret News. Cuban previously celebrated Dogecoin on Twitter. He said the cryptocurrency’s biggest issue is not being able to withdraw any of your Dogecoin holdings from the Robinhood app. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said he will try to change the Robinhood app to allow people to make sure they can withdraw their holdings, though.

Whether you're a relatively new investor or someone who's been putting their money to work on Wall Street for decades, there's always something new and interesting to see. Last year, it was the unparalleled uncertainty that arose from a once-in-a-century pandemic. In 2021, it's been the rise of the retail investor. While a lot of retail investors have been focusing on stocks with high levels of short interest -- e.g., GameStop\\xa0and AMC Entertainment\\xa0-- we've also witnessed a huge bump in cryptocurrency valuations as a result of young investors putting their money to work. In recent weeks, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), the world's largest digital currency, nearly hit $65,000, while Ethereum\\xa0surpassed $2,600. But it's not Bitcoin or Ethereum that are creating the loudest buzz among crypto enthusiasts at the moment. That title belongs to Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE). Image source: Getty Images. At one point last week, Dogecoin tokens were going for north of $0.43. That may not sound like a lot, but it gave the digital currency a market cap of more than $55 billion. To put this into some context, Dogecoin was worth more than the market value of companies like Kraft Heinz, Ford, and Twitter. It also briefly made Dogecoin one of the five most-valuable digital currencies. Daily trading volume has also gone through the roof. Roughly one year ago, 200 million to 300 million Dogecoin were traded daily. Over the past two weeks, we've witnessed anywhere from 11.9 billion to 69.4 billion Dogecoin change hands on a daily basis. In short, it's become the poster child of crypto momentum in a matter of months. But even with a roughly 11,000% gain over the trailing-12-month period, Dogecoin has all the look of a pump-and-dump asset that investors should avoid like the plague. Here are five key reasons Dogecoin belongs nowhere near investors' portfolios. Image source: Getty Images. Arguably the biggest knock against\",\n",
       "  'Filed under: Dogecoin will soon hit an all-time high if current trends continue   Dogecoin continued to see its value spiked to a new level, reaching a worth of $40 million in total. And it’s seeking an all-time high. But analysts and experts recently said investing too much into cryptocurrency could become a problem for people. Dogecoin has been seeking a spike in value in recent weeks, as I’ve written for the Deseret News. Much of the rise can be attributed to the internet-only Doge Day and the fact that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban have been tweeting about it. \\n    Related\\n   Dogecoin is expected to hit an all-time high, according to Yahoo! Finance. According to Yahoo! Finance, the Dogecoin market is trending upwards, which might lead to a new all-time high. \\n    Related\\n   Multiple experts told Bloomberg that people are investing in Dogecoin for a number of reasons, most of which don’t have to do with earning money at all and more about being apart of the cultural movement of the meme-based cryptocurrency. Jeffrey Halley, the senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific, which helps trade traditional currencies, told Bloomberg that Dogecoin’s appeal is that it is cheap. Curtis Ting, managing director for Europe at the cryptocurrency exchange company Kraken, told Bloomberg that Dogecoin is part-meme and part-money, so it’s adding this psychological effect where people invest as a joke, which leads to the cryptocurrency being worth more.',\n",
       "  'A must-watch for investors everywhere. When Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD) enthusiasts created #DogeDay, many hoped that Dogecoin prices would go to $1. Even fifty cents would have been acceptable. Source: Shutterstock Instead, Apr. 20 marked one of Dogecoin’s worst days on record. Within hours, the coin had dropped from its open of around 40 cents to a close of 32 cents. By the end of the week, the “meme coin” had sunk below 20 cents, wiping out $25 billion of investor wealth. “There was anxiety with larger investors who had big positions that the dog had its day coming and wanted to exit,” said Eric Schiffer, the head of a private equity firm called The Patriarch Organization. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For all purposes, it looked like Dogecoin was dead. But momentum bulls would have the last laugh. As celebrities like Mark Cuban and Elon Musk began tweeting about the cryptocurrency, investors began to buy back in. Almost magically, Dogecoin prices started to rise again.  10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy  Now, as investors try to make sense of an asset with “zero intrinsic value,” momentum investors will continue to confound traditional ones. As this week has shown, Dogecoin might be dead — but just not quite yet. Cryptocurrency’s biggest inside joke has long confused conventional investors. All coins already have zero intrinsic value and Dogecoin made a point to satirize that fact. Its original 2013 code awarded up to one billion coins per solved block, making DOGE virtually unusable as a form of currency. Fast forward to 2021, however, and DOGE has emerged as one of the most serious money-makers of the year. $10,000 invested in Dogecoin at the start of the year would have turned to over $870,000 at its peak. Ordinary retail investors became overnight millionaires. Technologically, Dogecoin has also grown up. Its once ludicrous mining reward system now runs on a system that mimics a 2.5% inflation rate. A “merged mining” ability also allows miners to process DOGE in parallel with Litecoin (CCC:LTE-USD), significantly increasing its mining',\n",
       "  'Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has shot higher this week, adding a staggering 25% to its already huge recent gains.  The ethereum price, now within touching distance of $3,000 per ether, has been boosted by the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) debut digital bond sale, issued on the ethereum blockchain, and praise from Wall Street giant and bitcoin convert JPMorgan\\n\\nJPM\\n. However, even as ethereum investors and developers celebrate the soaring ether price, \"joke\" cryptocurrency dogecoin is rocketing further and faster—adding almost 50% to its price over the last week. Dogecoin, a tongue-in-cheek cryptocurrency originally created as a \"joke,\" has seen its price soar ... [+] through 2021, far outpacing the price rises seen by bitcoin and ethereum.  Dogecoin, based on the Shiba Inu doge meme and a favorite of Tesla \\n \\nTSLA\\n billionaire Elon Musk, has soared by almost 5,000% since its price exploded in January.

In a press conference that followed the Fed’s two-day meeting, Powell was asked whether he believed there was a risk to financial stability in trends such as the meme-inspired cryptocurrency.  The Shiba Inu-represented crypto, which was started as a joke, is up more than 6,000% year to date. The question was framed amid the backdrop of low interest rates and easy monetary policy that has sparked interest in speculative investnments such as GameStop’s stock and dogecoin. “You are seeing things in the capital markets that are a bit frothy, that’s a fact,” Powell said. “I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but also it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.” In a bid to combat the fallout from COVID-19, central banks around the world have poured new money into financial markets, which, in turn, has had a major impact on cryptocurrencies through asset price inflation. Powell was upbeat about the prospects for a swifter economic recovery in the U.S., pointing toward “very well-capitalized large banks” and low funding risks among financial institutions.  “What has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening,” he said',\n",

As Binance coin (BNB) comes close to hitting an all-time (ATH) high today, it is also shown that the Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is catching up to that on Ethereum (ETH).

In addition, reports indicate that the BSC-based decentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap (CAKE) transacted more than four DEXs on Ethereum’s blockchain, including frontrunners Uniswap (UNI) and Sushiswap (SUSHI).

The world\\'s second-largest digital currency by market value surged to a fresh record of $2,800 on Thursday morning, according to data from Coin Metrics. Bitcoin, the top digital coin, was slightly lower at a price of $54,471. The move comes after the European Investment Bank announced Wednesday that it had issued its first ever digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain, ether\\'s underlying network. This led to speculation that the currency is gaining traction among mainstream financial institutions. Most major cryptocurrencies were trading higher Thursday, boosted by ether\\'s rise. Bitcoin, the most valuable digital coin, is down about 16% from its all-time high of almost $65,000 earlier this month. It has still had a stunning rally, though, climbing almost 90% so far this year, on the back of increased interest from institutional investors and corporate buyers like Tesla. At the same time, some investors have warned of froth in the crypto market. Dogecoin, a meme-inspired digital token, rallied Wednesday after supportive tweets from celebrities like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. And plenty of other \"altcoins,\" or alternative currencies, have also rallied this year. This led to bitcoin\\'s dominance of the crypto market falling below 50% last week for the first time since August 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. The first time bitcoin\\'s share of the market sank below that level was in 2017, before a huge slump in crypto prices now referred to as a \"crypto winter.\" But bitcoin bulls contend things are different this time, as the rally is being driven by institutional demand rather than retail investors. \"There\\'s just so much hype from the institutions coming in,\" Carol Alexander, professor at the University of Sussex Business School, told CNBC last week. \"Bitcoin is almost like a sort reference point, the numeraire of crypto. I think there\\'s going to be sustained demand as institutional investors become more confident about the market.\" \"Having said that, on the more retail side that used to be in bitcoin, it\\'s not cool anymore,\" Alexander added.',\n",
       "  'Filed under: After it accidentally removed it in an earlier update Nvidia is trying again to limit the use of its RTX 3060 graphics cards for mining Ethereum, with a new update once again adding a hash limiter to the GPU, via VideoCardz.com.  If that sounds familiar to you, that’s because it’s not the first time that Nvidia has tried to nerf mining performance on the RTX 3060 — the company first rolled out new drivers that were intended to limit the hash rate of Ethereum mining by around 50 percent in February.  “We designed GeForce GPUs for gamers, and gamers are clamoring for more,” says Matt Wuebbling, head of global GeForce marketing at Nvidia, in a blog post announcing the change. The company also announced a new product, the Nvidia CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor), a dedicated GPU meant specifically for cryptocurrency mining.  However, that update was short-lived, with Nvidia managing to accidentally unlock its own limit in a beta driver released in March, undoing its previous work. Nvidia would go on to confirm that the new driver was a mistake, but it was already too late — the updated driver was out in the wild, and RTX 3060 owners were able to download it and avoid the new restrictions.  The new GeForce 466.27 driver, though, brings back the original limit and notes that it’ll be required for all future RTX 3060 cards starting in May. Nvidia may be looking to add hash rate limits to other cards, too.  A separate VideoCardz.com report notes that the company is working on an updated version of “LHR” (Lite Hash Rate) GPUs across the other RTX 30-series cards (including the RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, and 3080 models), in order to help discourage cryptocurrency miners from snapping up the limited stock before gaming-focused customers can. Only the top-of-the-line RTX 3090 may be exempt, as the $1,500 price tag already makes it of limited value for mining tasks.  Subscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.',\n",

Given all the talk around these digital assets, you might be wondering whether now is the time to invest. But before pulling the trigger, it’s always a good idea to have an understanding of the underlying asset. Cryptocurrency is no exception and it is quite different than investing in stocks or bonds. Read: Dogecoin’s Major Price Increase: Is It a Worthwhile Investment? Therefore, we will cover a popular blockchain technology called Ethereum (ETH). Like many blockchains, Ethereum has a native coin called ether. Let’s take a closer look at what Ethereum is and whether you should consider investing. Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain technology. Ethereum’s native coin is called ether. This coin is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin (BTC). Although ether has a smaller market cap than Bitcoin, Ethereum is the most widely-used blockchain. See: What Is Chainlink and Why Is It Important in the World of Cryptocurrency? One thing that is important to understand about Ethereum is that it is not the same as Bitcoin. Whereas Bitcoin’s purpose is primarily to be a digital currency, Ethereum is much broader. In fact, Ethereum is an open-source operating system and computing platform. It also supports distributed applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Another key aspect of Ethereum is that it enables decentralized finance, which is an important part of how the system works. Because the system is inherently decentralized, there is not a single entity controlling it or the value of ether.

Bitcoin’s price Friday jumped over $4,600 within a 24-hour period, settling a bit as of press time, at $56,996.\\xa0 “One reason we may be seeing the upswing in bitcoin’s price is because of the expiration of $4.2 billion in bitcoin options contracts today,” noted Steve Ehrlich, chief executive officer at investment firm Voyager Digital. “Historically, there have been price dips in the days leading up to a bitcoin options expiry, only for it to rebound thereafter.” For most of this week, bitcoin’s price struggled to make gains. The last time bitcoin traded at the $57,000 level was almost two weeks ago, on April 17. “What we’re experiencing is likely the rebound, which further confirms the continued bullishness around bitcoin,” Ehrlich said.\\xa0 The options expiration may have caused some traders to return to the spot market Friday as buyers pushed the price up, noted Nate Cox, the chief investment officer of crypto brokerage Two Prime. “The majority of long calls and puts for the April monthly contracts are expiring worthless,” Cox said. “Needless to say, bitcoin didn’t move the way many derivative traders expected this month.”\\xa0 Read More: Bitcoin Jumps 6% to $57K as Market Shrugs Off $4B+ Options Expiry This momentum may subside, however.

In a new tweet, the head of the on-chain analytics platform says that he’s witnessing large Bitcoin transfers that are likely happening over the counter (OTC). “Whales have been accumulating BTC. Massive Bitcoins have transferred, but these transactions are not from exchanges. Possibly OTC deals. NVT golden cross remains very low, meaning transaction volume is big compared to the market cap.” According to CryptoQuant, the NVT (Network to Value Transactions) golden cross is a signal that indicates the formation of a local top or bottom. A value below -1.6 suggests that Bitcoin may be poised for a strong leg up. At the end of April, the NVT golden cross metric had a value of -2.95. “NVT Golden Cross indicator hit a year low. BTC has upside potential from the perspective of the NVT valuation model.” In addition, Ki highlights that whales are transferring BTC to derivative exchanges, indicating that they might bet on Bitcoin’s ascent in the short term. “A significant amount of BTC moved to derivative exchanges from other exchanges, meaning whales might open a long position by using their BTC as collateral. This happened in the dip.” Another signal that indicates massive whale accumulation according to Ki is the surging Coinbase premium, which he says is a sign that institutional investors are buying Bitcoin. “Institutions like Tesla use Coinbase Prime brokerage to buy or sell BTC. It would be bulk orders that can affect BTC price. Coinbase premium has been negative/neutral for the past 7 weeks, but it turned positive lately, hitting an all-time high a week ago.

       "  ' Berkshire Hathaway\\xa0Vice Chairman Charlie Munger\\'s disdain toward bitcoin has only intensified amid the digital asset\\'s record run this year. \"Of course I hate the bitcoin success,\" the 97-year-old Munger said during a Q&A session at Berkshire\\'s annual shareholder meeting Saturday. \"I don\\'t welcome a currency that\\'s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth, nor do I like just shuffling out of your extra billions of billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air.\" \"I think I should say modestly that the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization,\" said Munger, a legendary investor in his own right. Warren Buffett, who avoided the initial question on bitcoin earlier, responded to Munger\\'s answer: \"I\\'m alright on that one.\" The \"Oracle of Omaha\" said he didn\\'t want to comment directly on the digital token because he didn\\'t want to get grief from everyone who is long. The world\\'s largest cryptocurrency enjoyed a head-turning rally this year, topping $60,000 apiece in April as involvement from Tesla to major Wall Street banks made bitcoin mainstream. Tesla recently\\xa0made a $1.5 billion bet on bitcoin\\xa0and now\\xa0accepts the digital currency as a method of payment\\xa0for its cars. Meanwhile,\\xa0Goldman Sachs\\xa0and\\xa0Morgan Stanley\\xa0are\\xa0looking to offer their wealthy clients some exposure to bitcoin. Bitcoin last traded above $57,000, up from about $30,000 at the start of 2021, according to Coin Metrics. Munger has long criticized bitcoin for its extreme volatility and a lack of regulation. At the annual shareholders meeting for Daily Journal in February, Munger said bitcoin is too volatile to serve well as a medium of exchange. \"It\\'s really kind of an artificial substitute for gold. And since I never buy any gold, I never buy any bitcoin,\" Munger said then. \"Bitcoin reminds me of what Oscar Wilde said about fox hunting. He said it was the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable,\" he added.

Those questions are currently before the Securities and Exchange Commission which is being asked in at least nine applications for the green light to launch what could be the first cryptocurrency ETF in the country. But a decision may have to wait at least until mid-June. The SEC this week delayed rendering a decision on a bitcoin ETF from asset manager VanEck that, if cleared, would be listed by CBOE Global Markets. The Commission said it was \"appropriate\" to take more time for consideration. The arrival of a bitcoin ETF in 2021 would follow this month\\'s start of trading in shares of Coinbase, the first cryptocurrency exchange to go public, as well as expanding acceptance of bitcoin as payment methods by companies including electric vehicle maker Tesla. Meanwhile, investment bank JP Morgan is preparing to introduce its first bitcoin fund for wealthy clients. These and other bitcoin developments may signal the increased likelihood that a bitcoin ETF will gain approval, but the SEC has rejected other attempts. Institutions \"are getting in from hedge funds on Wall Street to PayPal, to Venmo, to Visa. So [the SEC] can\\'t really ignore this because the market is deciding that they',\n",

       "  'A reimagination of “Beyond Order” by Jordan Peterson through the lens of Bitcoin. This writing mirrors the exact chronological structure of “Beyond Order,” offering reflection through a Bitcoin lens. This is part 3 of a 12-part series. If you read the book, it adds a second dimension. All quotes credited to Jordan Peterson. All reflections inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto. “Do not pretend you are happy with something if you are not, and if a reasonable solution might, in principle, be negotiated. Have the damn fight.” Governments assume the guise of the savior handing out trillions in stimulus money. When prices rise, they deny. Don’t pretend to be happy with your country’s monetary policy if you are not. The wealthy who already own assets get richer, the middle-class savers lose purchasing power, and the lower class watch the little they have vanish. The government is not here to save you. All currencies are being debased. Central banks are in a race to the bottom. The United States is printing with such intensity the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) discontinued updates to its M1 Money Stock and M2 Money Stock charts. This censorship hides the unwanted in the fog.  Bitcoin gives the ordinary worker a fighting chance. Check out John Vallis’ podcast on Decentralized Grazing. His guests, UntappedGrowth and BitcoinAndCows, apply the Bitcoin ethos, restoring America’s soil bank, earning self-sovereignty and sidestepping fiat debt. His model forms a mutually beneficial trinity between investors, ranchers and landowners, who serve their own interests but create exponentially more fruit together through the wisdom of low time preference collaboration. That clears the fog. It puts the farmers and ranchers back to being caretakers of the soil instead of strip miners. This allows them to become stewards again because they are providing for themselves not just today but for tomorrow. Landowners by healing the land, herd owners by preserving the heritage cattle, and ranchers by doing the work. All together as one. It’s easier to aim at a brighter future when you step outside the fiat fog.  Have the damn fight, because you',\n",
